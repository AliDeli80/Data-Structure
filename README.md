## Project Title

Data Structures in Python

## Description

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in Python. Each data structure is accompanied by clear explanations and examples to aid understanding.

## Data Structures Implemented:

### Arrays:
- One-dimensional arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays

### Linked Lists:
- Singly linked lists
- Doubly linked lists

### Stacks

### Queues:
- Binary trees
- Binary search trees
- Heaps

### Graphs:
- Undirected graphs
- Directed graphs

and more data structure codes.

## How to Use

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/AliDeli80/Data-Structure.git
  ```
